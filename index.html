    <h2>Revit Architecture Model</h2>

    <p>This is a long term project alongside three other group members. We all modeled houses from floorplans, or our own constructed ones using Revit software. Then, the house models were imported into Lightburn in which we could rescale and cut each piece of the home individually. Using a 1/4 by 1 in. scale, the homes were then constructed and modeled using cardboard and glue. I created a two-story home with original floorplans designed using engineering paper. After initial drafts, the model was then created in Revit, according to size and constructed. In order to laser cut the appropriate pieces, east, side, west, and south views were printed. The fifteen separate roof pieces were all individually placed onto sheets, angled at their respective direction of view, imported as DXF files, and scaled and printed. The model is constructed using wood glue and pins, made entirely of 1/4 in. single ply cardboard.

      <h2>C-STEM Girls Camp Presentation</h2>

      <p>This was a week-long summer camp designated to evoke a sense of creativity in its participants. The goal was to create a coded robot using Linkbots that had a function which could serve a helpful purpose in the world. I worked alongside 3 others in order to create a slideshow presentation which would be showcased at the end of the week to the parents (or anyone else who wanted to show up for that matter) about the planning, demonstration and execution of the project. We decided to code a robot that could help sweep tables using a 3D printed trash can.
