    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="img/doggy.png" alt="doggy" />
    <p> I’m a seventeen year old senior at Benicia High School just trying to get by in life. In general, I take an interest in STEM-related subjects, and I’m currently struggling with Calculus AB. Although I may not be the biggest math person, I do enjoy problem solving and any sort of challenge that forces me to think creatively! It’s just fun to be out of the ordinary I think. Anyways, I like little fluffy dogs with funny haircuts, and my favorite thing to eat is ice cream. My hopes for the future is to find a job in civil/environmental engineering. </p>
